# PDF Support Added! 📄

## What's New

Your UX Synthesizer now supports **PDF file uploads**! You can upload research reports, interview transcripts, and survey results in PDF format.

## How It Works

1. **Upload PDF**: Click the upload button and select any PDF file
2. **Auto-Extract**: The system automatically extracts all text from the PDF
3. **Analyze**: Click "Analyze Research Data" to process the content

## Supported File Types

✅ PDF (.pdf) - **NEW!**  
✅ Text files (.txt)  
✅ Word documents (.doc, .docx)  

## Technical Details

### PDF Processing Flow

1. User uploads PDF file
2. File sent to `/api/extract-pdf` endpoint
3. `pdf-parse` library extracts text content
4. Extracted text populates the textarea
5. User can review/edit before analyzing
6. Analysis proceeds as normal

### Components Updated

- **`components/UploadSection.tsx`**

## Tips for Best Results

- **Searchable PDFs**: Works best with PDFs that have selectable text
- **Scanned Documents**: May not work with image-based PDFs (consider OCR first)
- **File Size**: Works with PDFs up to several MB
- **Multi-column**: Text from multi-column layouts may appear out of order

## Example Use Cases

📊 **Research Reports** - Upload full research documents  
🎙️ **Interview Transcripts** - Direct from transcription services  
📋 **Survey Results** - Exported survey data with comments  
📱 **Usability Test Reports** - Complete testing documentation  
📄 **Academic Papers** - Research methodology and findings

**Note:** If a PDF doesn't work (image-based scans, etc.), you can always copy-paste the text manually into the textarea!

Enjoy the new PDF support! 🎉
