# Sample UX Research Data

This is sample interview transcript and usability testing data you can use to test the UX Synthesizer.

## Interview Transcript - Participant 1 (Sarah, 32, Marketing Manager)

**Interviewer:** Tell me about your experience using the online shopping platform.

**Sarah:** Honestly, it's been pretty frustrating. I do most of my shopping on my phone during my lunch break or commute, and the mobile site is just... not great. The buttons are so tiny I keep tapping the wrong things. Last week I tried to buy a birthday gift and gave up halfway through because it was taking too long.

**Interviewer:** What specifically made it take too long?

**Sarah:** The checkout process has like 5 or 6 different pages. Why do I need to confirm my shipping address three times? And then at the end, I wasn't even sure if my order went through because there was no clear confirmation. I had to check my email to make sure it actually processed.

**Interviewer:** What would make this better for you?

**Sarah:** Just streamline everything. I want to get in, find what I need, and check out quickly. Maybe save my preferences so I don't have to enter the same information every time. And make the mobile experience actually usable - bigger buttons, clearer steps.

## Interview Transcript - Participant 2 (Mike, 41, Software Engineer)

**Interviewer:** How do you typically approach making a purchase on the site?

**Mike:** I'm pretty methodical. I like to research everything before I buy - read all the specs, compare different options, check reviews. That's where this site falls short for me.

**Interviewer:** Can you elaborate on that?

**Mike:** Well, first of all, the product pages don't have all the information I need. I wanted to compare three different laptops last month, and I couldn't find basic specs like RAM and storage capacity on two of them. I ended up going to the manufacturer's website directly.

**Interviewer:** What about the comparison features?

**Mike:** That's another issue - there's no way to compare products side by side. I had to open like 10 tabs and switch back and forth. And the search is basically useless. I tried filtering by specific attributes and it just showed me everything instead of what I asked for.

**Interviewer:** What keeps you coming back then?

**Mike:** The prices are good and shipping is fast. But if I can't find the information I need to make an informed decision, I'll just buy from somewhere else even if it costs a bit more.
